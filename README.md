This is a simple [`express`](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) NodeJS server application. It configures REST API for basic user authentication flow and manages authenticated user watchlist for the frontend [repository](https://github.com/merthelva/movie-browser-app-frontend) and [application](https://movie-browser-app.vercel.app/). For database and CRUD operations, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) are used, respectively. The application is hosted by [heroku](https://heroku.com). Please note that this is the first attempt to develop a simple Backend application, so the code written may seem a bit unprofessional. :) Still, any kind of contribution(s), comment(s), improvement(s) and suggestion(s) are kindly welcomed.
